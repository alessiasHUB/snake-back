# Academy Express Starter

This is set up as a quick starter for a no-persistence RESTful Express API (using just an array for in-server memory).

## Getting started

### Shaping the 'database'

`db.ts` is set up for a generic `DbItem` - you may want to reshape and rename that interface.

### Install dependencies
```
yarn
```

### Run server
```
yarn start
```

Or, for dev mode (restarts server automatically when relevant files change):
```
yarn start:dev
```
